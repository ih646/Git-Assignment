 >I found this article interesting because it very clearly summarises the importance of hands-on  
work over theory, the need for unit tests and the importance of the software methodology and version  
control. The main thing I found interesting, however, is the writer's opinion that an individual's personality
is imprinted in the code he or she writes. After giving it some thought, I too agree that everything- from the 
way we indent to our documentation style reflects to a certain degree the kind of person we are.

>I also found the section on individual personalities interesting. What I also liked about the article is the section on "Code must live". The sentence on how IBM mainframes are still running COBL code stuck out because it shows us that code that we are writing now may still need to be maintained decades from now.
