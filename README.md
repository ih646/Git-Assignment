 >I found this article interesting because it very clearly summarises the importance of hands-on  
work over theory, the need for unit tests and the importance of the software methodology and version  
control. The main thing I found interesting, however, is the writer's opinion that an individual's personality
is imprinted in the code he or she writes. After giving it some thought, I too agree that everything- from the 
way we indent to our documentation style reflects to a certain degree the kind of person we are.
